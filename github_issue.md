**Issue Title:** Feature Request: Add a skills section to the portfolio

**Issue Description:**

**Problem:**
The portfolio website currently has sections for "About Me", "My Projects", and "Contact Me". However, it does not have a dedicated section to showcase the owner's skills.

**Proposed Solution:**
I propose adding a "Skills" section to the portfolio website. This section should list the skills of the owner in a clear and concise way. The skills can be categorized (e.g., Programming Languages, Frameworks, Tools) to make them easier to read.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A "Skills" section is added to the `index.html` file.
*   The "Skills" section appears between the "About Me" and "My Projects" sections.
*   The section should have a heading "My Skills".
*   The skills are presented in a list format.
*   The skills can be categorized with subheadings.

**Additional Information:**

*   You can use a simple list (`<ul>`, `<li>`) for the skills.
*   For styling, you can add a new CSS class for the skills section or reuse existing styles.

**Thank you for your consideration!**
